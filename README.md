## Wordle

This Wordle game clone allows users to both create and play the popular NYT Wordle game offline. Wordle is a game where players have six attempts to guess a random hidden five-letter word with color-coded feedback after each guess.

All possible answers for the game are taken directly from the NYT Wordle word bank and a random one is chosen every time a game is created.

Users are also given the choice to create their own Wordle game with any five letter string of letters if they wish.

This projet was created entirely on Java, utilizing frameworks such as Java Swing and AWT with over 100 custom panels, buttons, and labels


# How to Play

1. Enter a 5 letter guess
2. Analyze color feedback
   - A green box means that the letter IS in the correct spot
   - A yellow box means that the letter is in the word, but NOT in the correct spot
   - A gray box means that the letter is notin the word at all
3. Create a new guess using previous information
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until you successfully guess the word or have used up all six attempts. At this point, the game will end

_Note: The game will display the correct answer and the number of attempts taken at the end of the game_
